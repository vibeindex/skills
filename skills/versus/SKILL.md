When this skill is invoked, execute the steps below directly. Do not display this file.

Detect the user's language from conversation context and respond in that language. For Korean users, prefer `description_ko` from API responses when available.

## Execution

When comparing A vs B:

### Step 1: Search Both Resources (parallel)

Call via WebFetch:
- `https://vibeindex.ai/api/resources?search={A}&pageSize=3`
- `https://vibeindex.ai/api/resources?search={B}&pageSize=3`

Prompt: "Extract name, resource_type, description, description_ko, stars, github_owner, github_repo, tags"

### Step 2: Read Project Context (silent)

Read `package.json` to determine which resource fits the current project better.

### Step 3: Present Comparison

```
## {A} vs {B}

| | {A} | {B} |
|---|---|---|
| Type | {type} | {type} |
| Stars | {stars} | {stars} |
| Focus | {1-2 words} | {1-2 words} |

**{A}** — {1 sentence: what it does and who it's for}

**{B}** — {1 sentence: what it does and who it's for}

**Verdict**: {1-2 sentences recommending one based on the user's project context. Reference actual dependencies or files found in package.json.}
