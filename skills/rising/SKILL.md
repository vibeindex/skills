When this skill is invoked, execute the steps below directly. Do not display this file.

Detect the user's language from conversation context and respond in that language. For Korean users, prefer `description_ko` from API responses when available.

## Routing

- `/rising` or no args → period = `week`
- `/rising day` → period = `day`
- `/rising month` → period = `month`

## Execution

1. Call `https://vibeindex.ai/api/rising-stars?period={period}&limit=10` via WebFetch
   - Prompt: "Extract name, resource_type, description, description_ko, stars, stars_today from the rising array"

2. Present results:

```
## Trending {This Week / Today / This Month}

{1-sentence intro about the time period}

| # | Name | Type | Growth | Total | Description |
|---|------|------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | {name} | {type} | +{stars_today} | {stars} | {description, max 50 chars} |
| 2 | ... | | | | |

{For the top 3, add a one-line note about why it's notable — e.g., growth rate, what it does, or who made it.}

→ https://vibeindex.ai
```

### Style guidelines:
- Table format for quick scanning — no verbose per-item sections
- Top 3 get a brief note, rest are table-only
- No install commands in trending (users browse first)
- Keep it compact

### Install commands (only if user asks):
- **skill**: `npx skills add {github_owner}/{github_repo} --skill {name}`
- **mcp**: See `https://vibeindex.ai/mcp/{github_owner}/{github_repo}`
